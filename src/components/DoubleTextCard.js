            Snax Media is a full-service digital marketing agency. We are a
            talented hard-working group of video-focused creatives who love
            helping businesses grow and flourish. We come from an array of
            backgrounds, and all love the creative fluidity of dynamic video
            content. No project is too big or small, our scope ranges from small
            startups to large global brands.
            <br /> <br />
            Our team of videographers, editors, graphic designers, and web
            developers come together as one cohesive unit to create visually,
            emotionally, and rationally compelling content catered to your
            customers. We first get to know you, the client, to better
            understand the personality of your business. Then we work to
            understand the goals of the organization. Once we grasp the
            personality and goals our work begins.
